# Experimental/Optional Rules

## Lifeburn
When you fail on a check, you may burn 1 hit point to roll another die.

## Inspiration
The GM awards an inspiration die based on whatever criteria he/she deems
conducive to a fun game (usually the entertainment value of character choices).
This die may be rolled and added to a failed check, to give an additional chance
at success.

## Alternate Spell Casting Rules
By default, characters with the Wizardry extraordinary ability can cast each
spell they know once per day, and success is automatic (unless a saving throw)
negates it. Below are two alternatives to that approach.

### Sorcery (Alternative to Wizardry)
When attempting to cast a known spell, the character must make a spell check.
There is a chance of failure, but there is also a chance that you may cast a
spell multiple times. Additionally, critcal success or failure is a possibility.

#### Spell Check Chart
| d66 Roll | Result |
|:--------:|---------|
| 11       | Critical failure! Spell fails and the caster suffers a corruption. Roll on the corruption chart. |
| 12-16    | Spell fails and cannot be cast again that day. |
| 21-56    | Spell succeeds, but cannot be cast again that day. |
| 61-65    | Spell succeeds, and may be cast again. |
| 66       | Critical success! Spell has some aspect of its effect doubled (damage, number of creatures affected, duration, etc.) |

#### Corruption Chart
`TODO: Make a corruption chart`

### Life-Powered Magic
You can cast any spells you know as many times as you want, but each casting
costs 1 hit point.

## Helmet/Shield Shall Be Splitered
If a character has a helmet or a shield equipped, it can be used to negate a
hit when struck in combat. The item is destroyed after offering this benefit.
