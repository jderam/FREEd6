# Experimental/Optional Rules

## Lifeburn
When you fail on a check, you may burn 1 hit point to roll another die.

## Inspiration
The GM awards an inspiration die based on whatever criteria he/she deems
conducive to a fun game (usually the entertainment value of character choices).
This die may be rolled and added to a failed check, to give an additional chance
at success.

## Alternate Spell Casting Rules
By default, characters with the Wizardry extraordinary ability can cast each
spell they know once per day, and success is automatic (unless a saving throw)
negates it. Below are two alternatives to that approach.

### Sorcery (Alternative to Wizardry)
When attempting to cast a known spell, the character must make a spell check.
There is a chance of failure, but there is also a chance that you may cast a
spell multiple times. Additionally, critcal success or failure is a possibility.

#### Spell Check Chart
| d66 Roll | Result |
|:--------:|---------|
| 11       | Critical failure! Spell fails and the caster suffers a corruption. Roll on the corruption chart. |
| 12-16    | Spell fails and cannot be cast again that day. |
| 21-56    | Spell succeeds, but cannot be cast again that day. |
| 61-65    | Spell succeeds, and may be cast again. |
| 66       | Critical success! Spell has some aspect of its effect doubled (damage, number of creatures affected, duration, etc.) |

#### Corruption Chart
`TODO: Make a corruption chart`

### Life-Powered Magic
You can cast any spells you know as many times as you want, but each casting
costs 1 hit point.

## Helmet/Shield Shall Be Splitered
If a character has a helmet or a shield equipped, it can be used to negate a
hit when struck in combat. The item is destroyed after offering this benefit.

## Combat Maneuvers
When making an attack (combat check) against an enemy, you may choose to apply
one of the following conditions instead of dealing damage. However, the enemy
that gets hit may elect to defend against the maneuver, taking damage instead.
The idea is that attacks that are obviously much more detrimental than simply
taking damage will be defended against by the target.

## Conditions [Under Construction]
- **Blinded**
  - Cannot see
  - Combat checks against have advantage
  - Combat checks made have disadvantage
