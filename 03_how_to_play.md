# How to Play

## The Core Mechanic
**The d666 System** uses only standard 6-sided dice. Each player will need three dice.
Any time a character wants to attempt something where the GM determines success wouldn't be automatic, a *check* may be called for. Under most circumstances, a *check* is made on two dice, and if either die comes up 5 or higher, the *check* is considered successful.

The most common exception to this is if the character has a **skill** that applies to the *check*. In this case, if either die comes up 4 or higher, the *check* is considered successful.

## Situational Adjustments
Sometimes an aspect of the situation will grant a character *advantage* or *disadvantage* on their *check*. For example, a character trying to sneak past a guard that is asleep would have *advantage* on their *check* to move past unnoticed, while a character attempting to shoot an enemy from a great distance would have *disadvantage* on their *check*.
- **Advantage**: Check is made with three dice instead of two.
- **Disadvantage**: Check is made with one die instead of two.

## Combat
Combat is fast and easy. Follow these steps.
1. When a combat breaks out, start by rolling initiative. Two dice are rolled for each side and the totals are compared. The side with the highest roll acts first. Tied initiative rolls indicate simultaneous combat, and everyone gets to act, even if they are killed.
2. On a player's turn, a character can perform two actions. Examples:
    1. Move in to engage an enemy and make an attack with a melee weapon
    2. Cast a spell at an enemy, then move behind a rock in an attempt to avoid being shot by arrows
    3. Cover a great distance by using both actions to move
    4. Reload a ranged weapon, then fire it
    5. Make two melee attacks against an enemy that is already in melee range
3. Under normal circumstances, all successful attacks deal 1 point of damage. Record damage taken as it occurs.
4. Once all characters and monsters have had their turn, the combat round is over, and starts again at the beginning. Initiative is rolled anew at the beginning of each round. This continues until one side is defeated, retreats, or surrenders.

## Crits and Fumbles
- **Critical Hit**: When you get two 6s on your combat check (⚅⚅), you deal double damage with this extraordinary strike! (or other effect as determined by the GM)
- **Super-Critical Hit**: When the result of a combat check is three 6s (⚅⚅⚅ which is only possible when making the check with *advantage*) you instantly kill the target!
- **Fumble**: When *all* dice come up 1 (⚀), regardless of how many are rolled. You must spend your next action to regain your bearings (or other effect as determined by the GM).

## Movement
It is encouraged to keep movement abstract for the most part, in order to keep the tempo of play fast and fun. Stopping to measure distances is antithetical to the spirit of this game. That being said, if it becomes important enough to worry about, a character can generally move about 30' per action spent.

## Saving Throws
A *saving throw* is a check that is made in response to some dire circumstance. For example a trap door has opened beneath you and the GM calls for a *saving throw* to see if you're able to grab onto the side before falling onto the spikes below.

## Death and Dying
When a character is reduced to 0 hit points, they are unconscious and dying. On their next turn, the only thing they can do is make a *saving throw*. If successful, they gain one hit point, regain consciousness, and their turn ends. If the saving throw fails, they will get one more chance on their following turn to make a saving throw, but this time with *disadvantage*. Failure on this roll indicates death.  
If another character comes to their aid before their turn comes up, with perhaps a health potion or some healing magic, this whole saving throw business can be neatly avoided.

## Rest
A serving of food and water, combined with a full night's rest causes a character to fully regain any lost hit points.
