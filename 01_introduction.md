# Introduction
[Tiny Adventure Game] is a simple framework I’ve written to encourage fun and imaginative gaming.

## Design Goals
- Fast character generation.
- Simple, easy-to-learn game mechanics. Great for kids, first-time RPG players, and anyone who would enjoy a break from those more complex systems.
- Classless advancement system where a new character can play alongside an experienced character and not feel like they can't make a contribution to the adventure.
- Useable with classic D&D adventures, by applying a simple on-the-fly monster conversion.
