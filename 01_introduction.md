# Introduction
The **d666 System** is a simple framework Iâ€™ve written to encourage fast, fun, and imaginative gaming.

## Design Goals
- Minimal materials needed. Each player just needs three regular six-sided dice, a pencil, and a piece of paper.
- Fast character generation, so more time can be spent playing the actual adventure.
- Simple, easy-to-learn game mechanics. Great for kids, first-time RPG players, and experienced gamers looking to enjoy a break from those more complex systems.
- Classless advancement system with support for campaign play, where characters of varying levels can play alongside one another without feeling a large disparity in power.
- Useable with OSR or classic D&D adventures, by applying a simple on-the-fly monster conversion.
