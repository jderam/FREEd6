# Hex Crawling Procedure

Move points (MV) are a _party_ resource. The party has 3 MV points to spend per day.
Each hex costs a number of MV points to enter, as shown in the [Terrain Chart](#terrain-chart) below.

- This assumes 6-mile hexes.
- If all party members have horses or other mounts, daily MV points are increased by 1.
- Entering a hex using a road/trail always costs only 1 MV, regardless of terrain type.
- Add +1 to the cost when crossing a river to enter a hex.
- If a group has MV points, but not enough to get into the next hex, they
may rest and carry 1 MV point over to the next day.

At the end of the day, establish a camp. Each PC, mount, or companion animal requires
1 lb of food and 1 quart of water in order to regain spells and HP. Failure to eat/drink
results in the loss of 1 HP.


## Hunting / Foraging

The party may spend a MV point to make a check to hunt or forage for food. If any PC in the party has the **Survival** skill,
it applies to the check. A successful check results in 2d6 DARO lbs of food.
