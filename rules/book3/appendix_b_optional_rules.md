# Experimental/Optional Rules

## Lifeburn
When you fail on a check, you may burn 1 hit point to roll another die.

## Inspiration
The GM awards an inspiration die based on whatever criteria he/she deems
conducive to a fun game (usually the entertainment value of character choices).
This die may be rolled and added to a failed check, to give an additional chance
at success.

## Alternate Spell Casting Rules
By default, characters with the Wizardry extraordinary ability can cast each
spell they know once per day, and success is automatic (unless a saving throw)
negates it. Below are two alternatives to that approach.

### Sorcery (Alternative to Wizardry)
When attempting to cast a known spell, the character must make a spell check.
There is a chance of failure, but there is also a chance that you may cast a
spell multiple times. Additionally, critcal success or failure is a possibility.

#### Spell Check Chart
| d66 Roll | Result |
|:--------:|---------|
| 11       | Critical failure! Spell fails and the caster suffers a corruption. Roll on the corruption chart. |
| 12-16    | Spell fails and cannot be cast again that day. |
| 21-56    | Spell succeeds, but cannot be cast again that day. |
| 61-65    | Spell succeeds, and may be cast again. |
| 66       | Critical success! Spell has some aspect of its effect doubled (damage, number of creatures affected, duration, etc.) |

#### Corruption Chart
`TODO: Make a corruption chart`

### Life-Powered Magic
You can cast any spells you know as many times as you want, but each casting
costs 1 hit point.

## Helmet/Shield Shall Be Splitered
If a character has a helmet or a shield equipped, it can be used to negate a
hit when struck in combat. The item is destroyed after offering this benefit.

## Combat Maneuvers
When making an attack (combat check) against an enemy, you may choose to apply
one of the following conditions instead of dealing damage. However, the enemy
that gets hit may elect to defend against the maneuver, taking damage instead.
The idea is that attacks that are obviously much more detrimental than simply
taking damage will be defended against by the target.

## Conditions [Under Construction]
- **Blinded**
  - Cannot see
  - Combat checks against have advantage
  - Combat checks made have disadvantage
- **Charmed**
  - Fast-talk checks against are made with advantage
- **Confused**
  - At the start of each turn, roll a die to determine behavior
    - 1-3: Do nothing
    - 4: Use all actions to move in a random direction
    - 5: Attack a random target; Do nothing if no one in range
    - 6: Move/act normally
- **Deafened**
  - Cannot hear
- **Frightened**
  - Disadvantage on checks against the source
  - Cannot move towards the source
- **Grappled**
  - Cannot move
  - Combat checks against the grappled by the grappler have advantage
  - Combat checks against the grappler by the grappled have disadvantage
  - Muscle check to escape
- **Poisoned**
  - Disadvantage on all checks
- **Prone**
  - Melee combat checks against have advantage
  - Ranged combat checks against have disadvantage
  - Combat checks made have disadvantage
  - Must spend an action to get up
- **Stunned**
  - Cannot move or speak
  - Automatically fails saving throws
  - Combat checks against have advantage
  - If you begin your turn stunned, the only thing you can do is make a check. If successful, you are no longer stunned and may act normally beginning on your next turn.

## Extraordinary Ability: Psionics
The character has a psionic ability which may be used up to thrice per day.
At the beginning of each day, roll on the following chart 1d3 times to
determine what powers are available that day.

| d66 roll | Psionic Power |
|:--------:|---------|
| 11-14 | **CLAIRAUDIENCE**: The user can hear through solid obstacles. A 2′ thickness of solid stone blocks the spell, as does even the thinnest layer of lead. Range: 60′ Duration: 2 hours |
| 15-22 | **CLAIRVOYANCE**: The user can see through solid obstacles. A 2′ thickness of solid stone blocks the spell, as does even the thinnest layer of lead. Range: 60′ Duration: 2 hours |
| 23-26 | **ESP**: The user can detect the thoughts of other beings. The spell cannot penetrate more than two feet of stone, and it is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Range: 60′ Duration: 2 hours |
| 31-34 | **MIND BLAST**: This attack of pure mental energy causes 3 dice of damage. Creatures possessing psionic powers can save vs. magic to avoid the damage. |
| 35-42 | **MIND CONTROL**: The unfortunate victim of this ability falls under the user's influence (Range: 120′). This psionic power can work on any intelligent creature for as long as the user intensely concentrates (no fighting or even walking). A saving throw vs. magic negates the effect. Animals are immune, as are the Old Ones. Attempting to mind control one of the Old Ones will cause the user to fall unconscious for a number of hours (roll a single die to determine how many) unless he makes a saving throw vs. breath weapon. |
| 43-46 | **PRECOGNITION**: This allows the user to tell what will happen only to himself if he were to do something. No more than 1 minute into the future can be seen. |
| 51-54 | **TELEKINESIS**: The user can move objects using mental power alone. The amount of weight he can lift and move is 20 pounds per level. Range: 120′ Duration: 1 hour |
| 55-62 | **TELEPATHY**: Direct mind-to-mind communication with intelligent beings, transcending language. Telepathic contact with an Old One is foolish, and the Referee will probably require a saving throw to avoid madness and/or horror. |
| 63-66 |
