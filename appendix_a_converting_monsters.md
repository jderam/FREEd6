# Converting a D&D Monster
To convert a classic D&D monster, use the number of Hit Dice as an approximation of hit points. Record the number of attacks and damage. As a general guideline, take the average damage of the attacks and have them deal 1 hit point of damage for every 5 points.

| D&D Average Damage | Damage Conversion |
|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1-5 | 1 |
| 6-10 | 1-2 or 2 |
|11+ | 2-3 or 3 |

Once you gain a sense of this, it will be easy to convert any D&D monster in your head on the fly if necessary.

### Hydra (Classic D&D version)
**Armor Class**: 5  
**No. Appearing**: 1 (1)  
**Hit Dice**: 5-12  
**Save As**: Fighter (see below)  
**Move**: 120' (40')  
**Morale**: 9  
**Attacks**: 5-12 (see below)  
**Treasure Type**: B  
**Damage**: 1-10 per head  
**Alignment**: Neutral  
A hydra is a large creature with a dragon-like body and 5 to 12 (1d8 + 4) serpentine heads. It has one hit die for each head, and always has 8 points per hit die. A hydra will attack with all of its heads each round. For every 8 points of damage a hydra takes, one head will no longer attack.  
**EXAMPLE**: If a 7-headed hydra took 18 points of damage, it would only attack with 5 heads in the next round. A hydra saves as a fighter of a level equal to its number of heads.

### Hydra (5-headed, converted version)

**Hit Points**: 10 (2 per head)  
**Attacks**: 1 bite per head for 1-2 damage each  
**Special**: For every 2 points of damage taken, one of the heads is killed and that head can no longer make attacks.  
**Conversion Notes**: We give 2 hit points per head. The D&D monster has only 1 hit die per head, but with maximum hit points, so in this case 2 hit points is a better approximation of that. The average damage is 5.5, which is greater than 5, but barely. So instead of dealing 2 damage, we will have each hit deal 1-2 damage.
