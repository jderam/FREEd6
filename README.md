### Online Character Generator
[https://jderam.github.io/d666-system/html/chargen.html?level=1&name=auto](https://jderam.github.io/d666-system/html/chargen.html?level=1&name=auto)

Edit query parameters in the url as follows:
- Update `level` to generate a character of a higher level, e.g. `level=5`
- Update `name` to modify how name is generated
  - `name=auto` will generate a random name
  - Use any other value to populate a specific name of your choice, e.g. `name=Steve`
  - Remove the `name` query parameter to leave name blank, so you can think about it and write one in later. Let's face it, naming is hard.
