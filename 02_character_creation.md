# Character Creation
New characters begin play at level 0 with the following. Record all information on a sheet of paper.
1. You begin play with 3 hit points.
2. Roll for a [starting equipment pack](05_equipment.md#starting-equipment-packs).
3. Roll for a [starting weapon](05_equipment.md#weapons).
4. Roll 3d6 to determine how many silver pieces (sp) you begin play with.
5. Name your character.
6. (Optional) Add any interesting details about your character's appearance, background, or mannerisms. You may wish to create a sketch of your character as well.

## Character Advancement
Characters will usually begin play as level 0 adventurers, although the GM might have characters
begin at a higher level if the adventure calls for it.
For each 2-4 hour session of play completed, the character gains an *Adventure Point*. 
Note that characters will generally gain more power from magic items and artifacts acquired on their adventures than they will from advancing though levels, but they will gain automatic street cred in the world based on their level or rank.

6. **Weapon Mastery**: Choose one specific weapon, e.g. *zweihander*. You are skilled in the use of this weapon, and combat checks made when using it are successful on a 4+.
