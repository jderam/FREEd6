# Character Creation
New characters begin with the following. Record all information on a sheet of paper.
    1. You begin play with 5 hit points.
    2. You are proficient on combat checks with one of the following (choose). Note that in combat, all hits deal 1 point of damage regardless of weapon type.
        1. Light melee weapons (one-handed)
        2. Heavy melee weapons (two-handed)
        3. Ranged weapons (two-handed, requires an action to reload)
        4. Unarmed combat (punches, kicks, wrestling, etc.)
    3. Choose two Skills you have mastered (see Skills section).
    4. Choose three Skills at which you are proficient (see Skills section).
    5. Choose two Extraordinary Abilities (see Extraordinary Abilities section).
    6. Roll for a starting equipment pack (see Equipment section).
    7. Roll 3d6 to determine how many silver pieces (sp) you begin play with.
    8. Name your character.
    9. (Optional) Add any interesting details about your character’s appearance, background, or mannerisms. You may wish to create a sketch of your character as well.

## Character Advancement
Characters begin play as Porcelain rank (level 1) adventurers.
For each adventure completed, the character advances in rank. An adventure may span one or more sessions of play, as determined by the GM. Generally, completing an adventure means fully exploring a small dungeon, or perhaps a single level of a large dungeon, or completing a quest.
When a character advances in rank, roll on the advancement chart to see what benefit is gained.
Note that characters will generally gain more power from magic items and artifacts acquired on their adventures than they will from advancing though adventurer ranks, but they will gain automatic street cred in the world based on their rank.
