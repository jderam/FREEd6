## Sorcery
Characters having the **Sorcery** extraordinary ability may attempt to cast a spell they know as an action. Make a d66 roll and look up the result on the Spell Check Chart below to determine the result.

### Spell Check Chart
| d66 Roll | Result |
|:--------:|--------|
| 11       | Spell fails and the caster suffers a corruption. Roll on the corruption chart. |
| 12-46    | Spell is successful, but cannot be cast again that day. |
| 51-65    | Spell is successful, and may be cast again. |
| 66       | Critical success! Spell has some aspect of its effect doubled (damage, number of creatures affected, duration, etc.) |

**Alternative Option**: Instead of requiring spell checks, spells are always successful but cost 1 hit point to cast.

## Read Magic
The **Read Magic** extraordinary ability allows an adventurer to read arcane or magical writing, which makes it possible to cast a spell from a scroll. Spellcasting from scrolls is much more reliable than casting a spell from memory, so no spell check is required. The spell always works, but the scroll is consumed once the spell is cast. When the **Read Magic** ability is gained, the adventurer gets two randomly determined scrolls to add to their inventory. Additional scrolls may be found during play.
